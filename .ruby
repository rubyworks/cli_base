summary: Command line tools, meet your Executioner!
created: '2008-08-08'
description: Think of CLI::Base as a COM, a Commandline Object Mapper, in much the
  same way that ActiveRecord::Base is an ORM, an Object Relational Mapper. A subclass
  of the CLI::Base can define a complete command line tool using nothing more than
  Ruby's own method definitions.
